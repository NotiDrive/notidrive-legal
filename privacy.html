  <h1>NotiDrive – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2 December 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how NotiDrive (“we”, “us”, “our”, or the “App”)
    collects, uses, and protects information about you when you use our mobile
    application and related services.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using NotiDrive, you agree to the collection and use of information in
    accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Account details</strong> – such as your email address and name when
      you sign up or log in.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>In-app preferences</strong> – such as settings, reminders, and
      notifications you configure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Support communications</strong> – such as messages you send to us
      via email or in-app support.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Usage data</strong> – such as how you interact with the App, which
      features you use, and basic technical information (device model, OS
      version, app version).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Diagnostic data</strong> – such as crash reports or performance
      data, to help us fix bugs and improve stability.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Location Information</h3>
  <p>
    With your permission, NotiDrive uses your location to detect when you are
    approaching or entering certain charge zones (for example, congestion or
    low-emission zones) so we can send relevant alerts and reminders.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Location may be used in the background to support driving alerts.</li>
    <li>You can disable location access in your device settings at any time, but some core features may stop working.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not use precise location for advertising targeting. It is used only to
    provide the App’s driving and notification features.
  </p>

  <h3>2.4 Subscription & Payment Information</h3>
  <p>
    Premium subscriptions are managed by Apple’s App Store or Google Play.
    NotiDrive does not store your full payment card details. We may receive
    limited information from Apple/Google (for example, subscription status,
    country, and whether you are in a trial or an active period).
  </p>

  <h3>2.5 Advertising and Analytics</h3>
  <p>
    The free version of NotiDrive may show ads using third-party ad networks
    such as Google AdMob. These services may collect:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA or Android Advertising ID).</li>
    <li>Approximate location (e.g. general region, not precise GPS).</li>
    <li>Basic device and usage information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is used to show relevant ads, measure ad performance, and
    help keep the free version of the App available.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core App functionality (alerts, reminders, zone detection).</li>
    <li>Maintain and improve the App’s performance and reliability.</li>
    <li>Personalise certain aspects of your experience (e.g. settings).</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates, changes, or support issues.</li>
    <li>Show ads in the free version (where applicable).</li>
    <li>Meet legal or regulatory requirements, if necessary.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal Bases (Where Applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    Where data protection laws apply (for example, in the UK or EU), we rely on
    one or more of the following legal bases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to provide you with the App and related services.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – such as improving the App and preventing abuse or fraud.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for things like optional analytics, ads personalisation, or notifications where required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>
  <p>We may share information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Service providers</strong> – such as hosting providers, analytics
      tools, and ad networks that help us operate and improve the App.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Platform providers</strong> – such as Apple and Google, in order
      to process subscriptions, payments, and store purchases.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Authorities or law enforcement</strong> – where required to do so
      by law, or to protect our rights or the rights of others.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. No Affiliation with Transport Authorities</h2>
  <p>
    NotiDrive is not affiliated or officially connected with Transport for
    London (TfL) or any other transport authority. When you follow a link to an
    external site (for example, a payment portal), you are subject to that
    site’s own terms and privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep your information only for as long as it is reasonably necessary to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App,</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations,</li>
    <li>Resolve disputes, and</li>
    <li>Enforce our agreements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can request deletion of certain information (for example, by contacting
    us), though some data may need to be retained for legal or technical
    reasons.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal
    data, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accessing the data we hold about you,</li>
    <li>Requesting corrections,</li>
    <li>Requesting deletion,</li>
    <li>Objecting to certain types of processing, or</li>
    <li>Withdrawing consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise these rights, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:notidriveapp@gmail.com">notidriveapp@gmail.com</a>. We may
    need to verify your identity before responding.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your
    information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely
    secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    NotiDrive is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly
    collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has
    provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can take appropriate
    action.
  </p>

  <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Our service providers may be located in different countries. Where required
    by law, we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for
    cross-border data transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update
    the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where appropriate,
    provide additional notice in the App. Your continued use of the App after
    changes are made means you accept the updated Policy.
  </p>

    data is handled, you can contact us at:
