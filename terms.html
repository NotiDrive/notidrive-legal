  <h1>NotiDrive – Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2 December 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to NotiDrive (“we”, “us”, “our”, or the “App”). These Terms of Use
    (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the NotiDrive mobile application
    and related services.
  </p>
  <p>
    By downloading, accessing, or using NotiDrive, you agree to be bound by these
    Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
  <p>
    NotiDrive is designed to help drivers by providing reminders, notifications,
    and helpful information related to driving and road charge zones (for example,
    congestion or low-emission zones). The App may:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use your location to detect when you are near or entering certain areas.</li>
    <li>Provide alerts and reminders so you can choose to pay relevant charges on time.</li>
    <li>Provide links to external websites or payment portals (such as official transport websites).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    NotiDrive does <strong>not</strong> process official payments for congestion,
    ULEZ, tolls, or any other government or authority-operated charge. All such
    payments are made directly via official third-party platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>3. No Affiliation with Transport Authorities</h2>
  <p>
    NotiDrive is an independent application and is not affiliated, associated,
    authorised, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Transport for
    London (TfL) or any other transport authority, government body, or public
    agency.
  </p>
  <p>
    All references to congestion charges, ULEZ, tolls, or similar services are for
    information and convenience only. Any logos, names, or trademarks of third
    parties remain the property of their respective owners.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>
    The App may contain links to third-party websites or services (for example,
    official payment sites). We do not control and are not responsible for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The content of third-party websites,</li>
    <li>Their privacy practices, or</li>
    <li>Any actions you take on those websites.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You access third-party websites at your own risk and should review their terms
    and policies separately.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Account & Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You must be legally able to enter into a binding agreement to use NotiDrive.
    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and any
    login details and for all activities that occur under your account.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Subscription, Free Trial & Payments</h2>
  <p>
    NotiDrive offers a free version (“Free Tier”) and an optional paid
    subscription (“NotiDrive Premium”), which may include features such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Early approach warnings to charge zones,</li>
    <li>Entry location map views,</li>
    <li>Quick and custom reminders, and</li>
    <li>An ad-free experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.1 Free Trial</h3>
  <p>
    We may offer a free trial period (for example, 7 days). The trial length and
    any promotion details will be shown clearly in the App and in the purchase
    confirmation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial</strong>,
    your subscription will automatically convert into a paid auto-renewing
    subscription (for example, £3.99/month or £34.99/year, depending on the plan
    you select).
  </p>

  <h3>6.2 Auto-Renewing Subscriptions</h3>
  <p>
    Subscriptions are billed through your Apple iCloud / App Store or Google Play
    account. The price, billing period, and any introductory offers will be shown
    in the App at the time of purchase.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your subscription automatically renews at the end of each billing period unless cancelled.</li>
    <li>
      Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours before the end of
      the current period at the current subscription price.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your device’s
      iCloud / App Store or Google Play Subscriptions settings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not issue refunds for unused portions of a subscription period, except
    where required by applicable law or by the App Store / Google Play refund
    policies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>You agree to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use NotiDrive in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
    <li>Drive responsibly and avoid interacting with the App while driving, where unsafe or illegal.</li>
    <li>
      Verify all information before relying on it (for example, zone boundaries,
      applicable charges, and payment deadlines).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You remain fully responsible for paying any congestion charges, tolls, ULEZ
    fees, fines, or penalties due. NotiDrive is not responsible for any penalties
    or financial losses caused by missed or incorrect payments.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Limitations of the Service</h2>
  <p>
    While we aim to keep information as helpful and accurate as possible, NotiDrive:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>May not always reflect real-time changes to charge zones or rules.</li>
    <li>May occasionally experience errors, bugs, or outages.</li>
    <li>May rely on third-party services (such as map providers or APIs).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the fullest
    extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied,
    including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and
    non-infringement.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any
    indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any
    loss of profits, revenue, data, or use arising out of or in connection with
    your use of the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, our total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection
    with the App will be limited to the amount you paid us (if any) in the 3
    months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All content in the App (including logos, design, text, graphics, and
    features) is owned by us or licensed to us, and is protected by intellectual
    property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative
    works based on the App, except as permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we
    reasonably believe you have violated these Terms or used the App in a way
    that may cause harm to us or others. You may stop using the App and uninstall
    it at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we
    will take reasonable steps to notify you (for example, via an in-app message
    or an updated date at the top of this page). Your continued use of the App
    after changes are made means you accept the updated Terms.
